# About this project
This project I started when I finished my home lab in balcony of my house.
I found that it is very cold in december. I decided to install floor heater to make temperature comfortable,
but first attempt been wrong. I had very hot floor. I decided to make floor heater with 5 zones (unformattly right now device have support for 6 zones)
